Our Project is a toned down version of Steam! Hence the name Steam0.5. As a User, you should be able to sign up, browse our selection of games and add it to your list. You should be able to look at other users, follow them and view what games they play and what badgegs they have. Clicking onto the Badges section renders all the badges and depending on whether you have the game on your list, you can add a badge to your personal list. A way to brag about how great you are in a specific game!
